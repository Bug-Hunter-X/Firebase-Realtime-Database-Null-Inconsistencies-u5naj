# Firebase Realtime Database Inconsistent Null Returns

This repository demonstrates an issue where Firebase Realtime Database returns null values inconsistently, even when the data exists in the database. The issue seems to be related to data type handling and occurs sporadically, making debugging challenging.  The solution attempts to mitigate the issue using defensive programming techniques.

## Bug Report

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic behavior where a call to retrieve a string value from the database sometimes returns `null`, even though the value is present in the database. The specific conditions causing this inconsistency are yet to be fully identified.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file offers a potential solution.  It adds checks to handle the unexpected `null` values gracefully, ensuring that the application continues to function correctly even when receiving unexpected `null` responses from the Firebase Realtime Database.

## Setup

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install Firebase dependencies: `npm install firebase`
3.  Configure your Firebase project and credentials.
4.  Run `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` to observe the behavior.
